            <h1>About Autism Strong Philippines</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Autism Strong Philippines is an advocacy project which promotes autism awareness in campuses, communities, schools, and workplaces across the country. It started by two adults on the spectrum as a dry-run project last June 2018; and officially launched December 2018. </p>
            <p>The advocacy started with just a few materials - pencil, permanent marker and white cartolina. They tried out as a marketing campaign on autism awareness and anti-bullying. They soon shared their experiences as self-advocates.</p>
